MovieRama

A small project named MovieRama. The application is (yet another)
social sharing platform where users can share their favorite movies. Each movie has a title
and a small description as well as a date that corresponds to the date it was added to the
database. In addition it holds a reference to the user that submitted it. Users can also
express their opinion about a movie by either likes or hates.
